# This is the fourth time I have completed this tutorial

## Todos -
1. Document process in a clear and concise markdown file
2. Include testing this time (I left it out on the last run-throughs)
3. Try to internalize the code (before I just got the gist)

## Goals -
1. After completing it this time, I would like to complete it without following the tutorial and modify it for use in my portfolio
2. Use the concepts I have learned outside of Rails to better understand what is going on here and then use what is going on here to apply to JavaScript frameworks and functionality
