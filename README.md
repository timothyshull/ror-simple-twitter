# Simplified Twitter
## railstutorial.org
This is the result of my most recent time time through the tutorial at railstutorial.org. My goals for this time were to document the entire process in detail and create a generalized map of the process. I also added in testing, which I had previously left out at the suggestion of another developer. My motivation for completing the tutorial again was to approach it like a type of practice and internalize the entire process in a deeper, more complete way than my previous times through it.
